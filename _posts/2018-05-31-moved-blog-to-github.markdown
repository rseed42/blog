# Update: Blog Migration to Github

For over a year now I have been running this blog on the [Ghost platform](https://ghost.org/) inside a cheap [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) instance. I needed a server for
some hobby projects, so it was not a big deal, I am not expecting big traffic here anyway. Recently I grew more ambitious (see [Engineering Learning Machines](https://www.engineering-learning-machines.com/)), therefore I don't have much use for the Digital Ocean instance anymore, so it didn't make sense to support it only for the blog. Fortunately, GitHub offers a free hosting solution called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (which I did use a couple of years back) that is free for lower-traffic sites like this one. This platform is based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static web page generator.

The migration was a breeze, mostly due to the [Jekyll Ghost Importer](https://github.com/eloyesp/jekyll_ghost_importer) plugin. The following post by [Nikhita Raghunath](https://nikhita.github.io/build-blog-using-github-jekyll) also
offers some valuable tips on how to configure your Jekyll instance as a blog.
