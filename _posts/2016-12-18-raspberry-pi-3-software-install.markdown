#### Preliminary Configuration

First, let's update the system:

```
vpetkov@raspi:~$ sudo apt-get update
```
and upgrade any available packages
```
vpetkov@raspi:~$ sudo apt-get upgrade
```
#### Useful Software Packages
First, let's install a familiar text editor. This goes a little bit against the minimalist concept, but since I am also using the Raspberry for development, it is actually useful to have something like that here. You are free to choose your tools, of course.
```
sudo apt-get install emacs
```
A mandatory package is Git
```
sudo apt-get install -y git
```
If you plan to program Arduino from the Raspberry Pi on the command line, then one very useful tool is the Python serial library.
```
sudo apt-get install -y python-serial
```
I like to use a terminal multiplexer to run long-running processes that I haven't daemonized yet:
```
sudo apt-get install -y tmux
```
A useful resource monitoring tool is a modern version of top:
```
sudo apt-get install htop
```
One of the most important commands is gpio utility of the wiringpi library. It can be used directly to turn on/off gpio pins and also to show their state.

```
sudo apt-get install wiringpi
```
Example test command

```
vpetkov@raspi:~$ gpio readall

#### Enable Some Kernel Features

If you want to connect some devices directly to the Raspberry, you might need to use a couple of additional features, so you can optionally enable them with the 
```
sudo raspi-config
```
tool.

More specifically, these are interfaces that allow you to program microcontrollers and connect some devices over i2c:

* Enable SPI interface
* Enable i2c interface
