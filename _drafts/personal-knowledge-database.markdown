Specifically for command-line tools it would be useful to have a reference of command. Also use the command-line fu. Typing a sentence like "check file for line ending characters" should lead to someting like
```
hexdump -C file
```

Maybe use a natural language processor to generate versions of the sentence to make it easier to search for.
